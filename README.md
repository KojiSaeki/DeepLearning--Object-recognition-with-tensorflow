# Object-recognition-with-tensorflow
We created various DNNs on tensorflow and did classification on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.
We have created a variety of modern Neural Networks like Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, VGG networks, Residual Neural Networks (ResNet), Highway network,
and Dense neural Network purely on tensorflow and tried their performance.

CIFAR-10 is a very well-studied dataset for object recognition in images, that was collected at University of
Toronto as a labelled subset of the MIT 80 million tiny images dataset (http://people.csail.mit.edu/torralba/
tinyimages/). It comprises 60,000 colour images (3x32x32 pixels), with 10 object classes. This has been split into
a training set of 40,000 images, a validation set of 10,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images. CIFAR-100 is
similar to CIFAR-10, but has 100 classes; the training set size is again 40,000 images with validation and test
sets each containing 10,000 images.
