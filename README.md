# Object-recognition-with-tensorflow

We have created a variety of modern Neural Networks like Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, VGG networks, Residual Neural Networks (ResNet), Highway network, and Dense neural Network purely on tensorflow and tried their performance on object recognition and classification on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.
